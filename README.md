## Description
A user adds three tasks to the task board and changes the state of two of them to in progress and then completion. The user then can sort and manage tasks in each column.
I am creating a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I will need to use the Day.js library to work with dates. I will read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

User Story:

AS A project team member with multiple tasks to organize
I WANT a task board
SO THAT I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project progress accordingly
Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a task board to manage a project
WHEN I open the task board
THEN the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)
WHEN I view the task board for the project
THEN each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)
WHEN I click on the button to define a new task
THEN I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog
WHEN I click the save button for that task
THEN the properties for that task are saved in localStorage
WHEN I drag a task to a different progress column
THEN the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing
WHEN I click the delete button for a task
THEN the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved tasks persist
The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Technologies-Used
The technologies used for the Third-Party APIs: Task Board are as follows:

jQuery: Used for DOM manipulation and event handling in the project management application to create interactive features.

jQuery UI: Utilized for creating interactive task boards, enabling drag-and-drop functionality for managing project tasks effectively.

Day.js: Integrated into the application to work with dates, ensuring efficient handling and display of project task due dates.

These technologies collectively contribute to the development of a dynamic and user-friendly task board application for managing project tasks within a team.

## Installation

To set up the environment for the Week 5 Challenge - Third-Party APIs: Task Board, follow these installation steps:

Clone the Starter Code:

Before starting the project, clone the starter code provided for the task board application. You can find the starter code by following the provided link.
jQuery and jQuery UI:

Ensure that you have jQuery and jQuery UI libraries included in your project. You can either download these libraries and include them in your project directory or link to CDN versions in your HTML file.
Day.js Library:

Download the Day.js library or include it via a CDN in your HTML file. Make sure to include the necessary script tags to load Day.js in your project.
Set Up Project Structure:

Organize your project files and folders as needed for the task board application. Ensure that your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are structured appropriately.
Start Coding:

Begin coding the task board application using the provided starter code as a base. Implement the necessary functionality to create a simple task board that allows team members to manage project tasks.

## Test-Instructions

Test and Debug:

Test your application to ensure that it functions as expected. Debug any issues that arise during testing to ensure a smooth user experience.
By following these installation steps and setting up the necessary libraries and project structure, you can start working on the Week 5 Challenge - Third-Party APIs: Task Board successfully.
